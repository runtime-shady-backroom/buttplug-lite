//! backport partition_dedup_by and partition_dedup_by_key from rust nightly

// source: https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/slice/mod.rs.html#2886-2888
// tracking issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54279
/// Moves all but the first of consecutive elements to the end of the slice satisfying
/// a given equality relation.
///
/// Returns two slices. The first contains no consecutive repeated elements.
/// The second contains all the duplicates in no specified order.
///
/// The `same_bucket` function is passed references to two elements from the slice and
/// must determine if the elements compare equal. The elements are passed in opposite order
/// from their order in the slice, so if `same_bucket(a, b)` returns `true`, `a` is moved
/// at the end of the slice.
///
/// If the slice is sorted, the first returned slice contains no duplicates.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// #![feature(slice_partition_dedup)]
///
/// let mut slice = ["foo", "Foo", "BAZ", "Bar", "bar", "baz", "BAZ"];
///
/// let (dedup, duplicates) = slice.partition_dedup_by(|a, b| a.eq_ignore_ascii_case(b));
///
/// assert_eq!(dedup, ["foo", "BAZ", "Bar", "baz"]);
/// assert_eq!(duplicates, ["bar", "Foo", "BAZ"]);

    // Although we have a mutable reference to `self`, we cannot make
    // *arbitrary* changes. The `same_bucket` calls could panic, so we
    // must ensure that the slice is in a valid state at all times.
    //
    // The way that we handle this is by using swaps; we iterate
    // over all the elements, swapping as we go so that at the end
    // the elements we wish to keep are in the front, and those we
    // wish to reject are at the back. We can then split the slice.
    // This operation is still `O(n)`.
    //
    // Example: We start in this state, where `r` represents "next
    // read" and `w` represents "next_write`.
    //
    //           r
    //     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
    //     | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 |
    //     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
    //           w
    //
    // Comparing self[r] against self[w-1], this is not a duplicate, so
    // we swap self[r] and self[w] (no effect as r==w) and then increment both
    // r and w, leaving us with:
    //
    //               r
    //     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
    //     | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 |
    //     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
    //               w
    //
    // Comparing self[r] against self[w-1], this value is a duplicate,
    // so we increment `r` but leave everything else unchanged:
    //
    //                   r
    //     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
    //     | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 |
    //     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
    //               w
    //
    // Comparing self[r] against self[w-1], this is not a duplicate,
    // so swap self[r] and self[w] and advance r and w:
    //
    //                       r
    //     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
    //     | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 3 |
    //     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
    //                   w
    //
    // Not a duplicate, repeat:
    //
    //                           r
    //     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
    //     | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 3 |
    //     +---+---+---+---+---+---+
    //                       w
    //
    // Duplicate, advance r. End of slice. Split at w.

    // SAFETY: the `while` condition guarantees `next_read` and `next_write`
    // are less than `len`, thus are inside `self`. `prev_ptr_write` points to
    // one element before `ptr_write`, but `next_write` starts at 1, so
    // `prev_ptr_write` is never less than 0 and is inside the slice.
    // This fulfils the requirements for dereferencing `ptr_read`, `prev_ptr_write`
    // and `ptr_write`, and for using `ptr.add(next_read)`, `ptr.add(next_write - 1)`
    // and `prev_ptr_write.offset(1)`.
    //
    // `next_write` is also incremented at most once per loop at most meaning
    // no element is skipped when it may need to be swapped.
    //
    // `ptr_read` and `prev_ptr_write` never point to the same element. This
    // is required for `&mut *ptr_read`, `&mut *prev_ptr_write` to be safe.
